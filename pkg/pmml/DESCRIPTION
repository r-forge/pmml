Description: The Predictive Modelling Markup Language (PMML) is a
        language for representing models, in an application independent
        way. Such models can then be loaded into other applications
        supporting PMML, including ADAPA from Zementis, Teradata
        Warehouse Miner and IBM's DB2. The package provides a generic
        pmml function to generate pmml for an object. Using a S3
        generic function the appropriate method for the class of the
        supplied object is dispatched. The package currently supports
        the export of PMML for linear regression, generalized linear 
        regression, multinomial logistic regression, SVMs, rpart
        classification trees, randomSurvivalForest, randomForest, and
        kmeans clusters.
